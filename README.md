# OSSC Pro HW with layout
==============

## No actual PCB was built from these files to validate the manufacturing.


This PCB full routing without DRC error, but I don't know how to make the trace length equal within a byte group. And the power doesn't optimized.

I share this PCB, may someone can finish it.
